## Reflection  

**Client and Requirements**  
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that develops individualized financial plans for its clients, including savings, insurance, investments, and retirement planning. The company wanted to modernize its web application and ensure that sensitive financial data remained secure. My task was to assess vulnerabilities and recommend secure coding practices to strengthen their systems.  

**What I Did Well**  
I was thorough in identifying vulnerabilities through both manual code review and dependency analysis. I also provided clear mitigation strategies that followed industry best practices. Secure coding is essential because it protects client data, prevents costly breaches, and builds customer trust. Software security directly contributes to a company’s long-term stability and reputation.  

**Challenges and Helpful Aspects**  
The most challenging part was analyzing third-party dependencies, since these often introduce hidden risks. This was also one of the most valuable parts of the project, as it gave me experience with tools like the **OWASP Dependency-Check Maven Plugin**, which I can use in future assessments.  

**Increasing Layers of Security**  
I applied multiple security layers, including strong input validation, secure encryption practices, and principle of least privilege. In the future, I would continue to use a combination of SAST (static analysis), DAST (dynamic testing), and penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities and decide on appropriate mitigation techniques.  

**Ensuring Functionality and Security**  
After refactoring the code, I ran functional tests to ensure the application behaved as expected and did not break features. I also re-scanned the application for vulnerabilities to confirm that no new security issues were introduced.  

**Resources and Tools**  
Key resources included:  
- OWASP Dependency-Check plugin  
- Oracle Java Secure Coding Guidelines  
- *Iron-Clad Java: Building Secure Web Applications* (course text)  
These reinforced best practices such as input validation, secure cryptography, and least privilege.  

**What to Show Employers**  
This project demonstrates my ability to:  
- Conduct a professional vulnerability assessment  
- Apply secure coding practices in Java-based applications  
- Use industry tools and frameworks to identify and mitigate risks  
- Document findings in a clear, professional way  

This artifact serves as evidence of my growing expertise in secure software development and would be a strong example to present to future employers.
